Clicky-Game

Memory game build using React JS library. Components state is managed to respond to user events.


1. The application renders botanical images to the screen. Each image listens for click events.
2. The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score is incremented by clicking an image for the first time. The user's score resets to 0 if they click the same image more than once.
3. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page randomly shuffle themselves.
4. When the user makes an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
5. Game is deployed with Github Pages. Click this link to play : <a href="https://ritafm.github.io/clicky-game/" rel="nofollow">clicky-game</a>
